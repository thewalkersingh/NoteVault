How I cracked the job at Microsoft 🎯

I received many messages regarding my preparation strategy for cracking Microsoft.

So instead of responding to each message, I have spent some time and prepared detailed posts📝 I Hope it will help you with the right preparations🤞

ℹ️ After reviewing some past Microsoft interviews experiences, I found that it asked mainly questions from the following section:

📚 Computer Fundamentals
📚 Data Structures & Algorithm
📚 System Design (HLD & LLD)

🔨Lets me explain in detail the strategies and resources for each section.

📚 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐬:

I have gone through all the important concepts of OS, OOPS, DBMS, and Networking.

📚 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 & 𝐀𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦(DSA):
 
⚠️In Microsoft, questions are asked from all the data structures so don't SKIP any.
  
I mainly prepared from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and the self-prepared DSA notes that you can download from my Telegram channel👉https://lnkd.in/gYXf3VxK

✅I tried to solve questions in order of brute force to best-optimized solutions.

✅For each question, First I tried to write algo/code on paper, and after verifying it then only wrote code on the machine.

✅Kept making notes of important questions.

✅After each chapter, I used to give Mock Interviews (In-person & Online) to test my knowledge.

✅After the mock Interviews, I felt that I am lacking in Dynamic Programming and Graphs concepts so spend extra time on these two topics to make them strong.

📚 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 (High-Level Design):

✅First I learned the key components of the system design (like Load balancing, Sharing, Data partitioning, Polling, etc) then start going through some problems.

✅I took help from the following resources in system design interview preparations:

✅System design questions are very open-ended, every person approaches them differently but by following the above resources you will get a good idea about what standard way to approach them.

✅I used to give mock interviews and discuss system design questions with my friends which helped me to understand how to approach system design questions and also learned things in depth.

✅I have gone through 20-25 real-time system design questions which helped me.

📚 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 (Low-Level Design):

For low-level design, I read the "Gang of Four" Design Pattern book and solved a couple of problems that helped me.

ℹ️Be consistent during preparations.

ℹ️Revision of past topics is really important, I tried to spend 20% of my time revising the previous and 80% on the current topics.

ℹ️Go for quality preparation rather than quantity as there is no fixed set of questions.

That's all about my preparation journey, hope it will help in your preparations🤞All the best 😊
